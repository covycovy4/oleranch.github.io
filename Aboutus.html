            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h3> Who we are </h3>
            <p>
                An organisation that was birthed from a realisation that unless we rise up and hold each otherâ€™s hands together we could lose generations. We have partnered with various organisations who have made this possible.
            </p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
                To be the hands, feet and voice of the vulnerable in their communities as we impact one life at a time through empowering children who are the future leaders of tomorrow, young girls, women and the youth. 
                To see communities and nations being transformed by the power of influencing (rather than changing) the way people think about themselves and embracing who they are.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Passion</h3>
            <p>Seeing humanity becoming all that God intended for them when he created them.</p>
            <h2>Our Uniqueness</h2>
            <p>Changing lives, impacting Africa, one community at a time.</p>
            <h3>Our Values </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrity</li>
                <li>Creativity and Innovation</li>
                <li>Excellence</li>
                <li>Love</li>
                <li>Respect</li>
